<h2>Do you have trouble studying? Are you looking for ways to stay focused and on task while avoiding distractions? Well, here are 3 tips to help you get the most out of your study sessions.</h2>

<h3>1. Take good notes.</h3>
<p>Start by always taking good notes. Make sure they are organized in a way that makes sense to you so you can reference them later. You can either hand-write them in a notebook, or use a device, but be sure to keep them all in one place. Color coding can help with organization as well.</p>

<h3>2. Study in increments.</h3>
<p>We’ve all waited until the last minute to study for a big exam, but cramming won't help you learn properly. It’s important to start early so you can take breaks in between. One effective method is the Pomodoro Technique. To do this, first break your work into sections. Then, sit down and study each section for 25 minutes. After this, take a 10 minute break. Repeat until you feel confident in your knowledge!</p>

<h3>3. Collaborate with others.</h3>
<p>Studying with other people can be a big help. You might learn things from them that end up helping you remember more content. You can quiz each other and help each other stay on task. Get to know a few students in your class so you can set a study session. This can make studying more fun, so it doesn't seem like work.
