<h2>Do you have trouble studying? Are you looking for ways to stay focused and on task while avoiding distractions? Well, here are 3 tips to help you get the most out of your study sessions.</h2>

<h3>Take good notes.</h3>
<p>Start by always taking good notes. Make sure they are organized in a way that makes sense to you so you can reference them later. You can either hand-write them in a notebook, or use a device, but be sure to keep them all in one place. Color coding can help with organization as well.</p>
